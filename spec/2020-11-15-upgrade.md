## Summary

When the median time past [1] of the most recent 11 blocks (MTP-11) is
greater than or equal to UNIX timestamp 1605441600, Bitcoin Cash will
execute an upgrade of the network consensus rules according to this
specification.

Starting from the next block these consensus rules changes will take effect:

* Bitcoin Cash's current difficulty adjustment algorithm will replaced
  by a new algorithm named `aserti3-2d`, referred to as 'ASERT' for short.

## ASERT

The ASERT algorithm is described in [full specification: ASERT](2020-11-15-asert.md).

## Automatic Replay Protection

Both before and after this upgrade, Bitcoin Cash full nodes and wallets
MUST enforce the following rule:

 * `forkid` [2] to be equal to 0.

## References

[1] Median Time Past is described in [bitcoin.it wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_timestamp).
It is guaranteed by consensus rules to be monotonically increasing.

[2] The `forkId` is defined as per the [replay protected sighash](replay-protected-sighash.md) specification.
