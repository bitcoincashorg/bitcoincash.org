1. Each meeting should in general be 1 hour.  Chairpeople should take a vote as to whether the meeting should be extended at the 50 minute mark.

2. Prior to the meeting, a collaborative document should be started and shared with the group by the whomever is acting as secretary of that meeting.  This will serve as the basis for the meeting summary.  It should be added as a pull request to the workgroups repository after it is finalized.

3. Meetings should begin with introductions by each participant, and a reminder of etiquette.

4. Meetings should generally be focused around discussing solutions to one or two specific problems.

5. Discussion should be focused around enumerating possible solutions, and the positives and negatives of each solution.

6. Meetings should ideally end with the chairperson determining:
    1. If there are any action items, and who is taking responsibility for each.
    2. If a follow up meeting is needed on this topic, and when it will occur.
    3. Any other consensus items.
