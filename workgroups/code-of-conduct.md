# Code of Conduct

These codes of conduct is the set of rules and expectations for individuals wishing to contribute to the Bitcoin Cash Workgroups.  Repeatedly not adhering to these codes of conduct will not prevent you from contributing code or other work-based merits, but it will prevent you from contributing to discourse.  Individuals breaking these codes of conduct will not be tolerated.

1. Disruptive behaviors that are strictly prohibited:
   * Non-constructive criticism
   * Name calling
   * Speaking over others
   * Intentional deception, pot-stirring, or otherwise inciting conflict
   * Otherwise being disruptive to professional discussion

2. Anonymity
   * You may remain anonymous, or you may use your real name.
   * A verifiable history is highly recommended regardless of the level of anonymity you choose. Fully anonymous users should have a reasonably long history of positive contribution to other online communities as well.
   * Anonymous members are encouraged to select names that make their anonymity intent clear. Forging real-sounding names will be considered intentional deception. Participants found to be using a false, but real-sounding name with the intent of deception, will be removed from all future discussions.
