1. Write a document detailing:
    - The problem to be solved
    - The requirements to solve the problem
    - Any economic impacts on the Bitcoin Cash system
2. Schedule a meeting with the relevant workgroup to discuss the idea.
3. Write a specification, working with several other people from the workgroup.
    - Include references to previous or alternative approaches to solve the problem.
4. Write example implementation.
5. Work to attract quality peer reviewers from each implementation. (The importance of this can not be understated, if no one is looking at a proposal, it is not going to be implemented anywhere).
6. Develop a rigorous test plan, including scheduling repeated meetings until testing plans are obtain rough consensus of the reviewers.
    - Test that it does what it says
    - Test that it doesn't do other things
    - Test performance
7. Develop reporting on the testing progress; seek out problems. The closer it gets to becoming real, the harder the peer reviewers will get with expectations of quality
